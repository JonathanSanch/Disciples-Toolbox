# Disciple's Toolbox

We were inspired to create Disciple's Toolbox because we found existing Bible apps on our phones to be lacking. We envisioned a web application that would serve as a comprehensive "toolbox" for organizing everything necessary for our spiritual health and growth. 

**What We Learned:**
Throughout this project, we've learned the power of innovation and the impact it can have on faith-based tools. We've also gained valuable experience in navigating new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web development.

**Project Building:**
- We combined various features into Disciple's Toolbox:
  - **Verse of the Day API:** Providing daily encouragement.
  - **Journal:** Enabling daily Bible notes, sermon notes, or personal journaling.
  - **Memory Scripture:** A dedicated section for favorite or memorization-worthy scriptures.
  - **Prayer List:** Allowing users to add, track, and mark fulfilled prayers.
  - **Bible Reading:** The entire Bible accessible on the website.
- We built the project using cutting-edge technology, including:
  - **BunJS:** Known for its incredible speed.
  - **ReactJS:** For a responsive and interactive user interface.
  - **ElysiaJS:** Empowering our backend functionality.
  - **MongoDB:** NoSQL DB ensuring secure data storage.


**Challenges Faced:**
Our journey wasn't without challenges. Being early adopters of BunJS and ElysiaJS, which had only been fully available for seven days when we started, meant facing a lack of documentation. Integrating the backend and frontend posed hurdles, especially in connecting the routes and MongoDB to the frontend view. JSON parsing for backend POST routes also presented difficulties.


**Acheivements:**
Despite these challenges, we're incredibly proud of what we've accomplished. We've harnessed novel technology to create a project we believe will revolutionize web development. Disciple's Toolbox isn't just a project; it's a testament to innovation, perseverance, and our commitment to making faith-based tools faster, more efficient, and accessible.
